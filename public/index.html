      <h3>Where has Lin been.....</h3>
      <p>My desire to have a career in technology started early with encouragement from my father.  I toyed with electronics projects as a teen and took my High School vocation Electronics Technology program.  I attended Johnston Community College securing an AAS in Electronic Engineering.  I worked in hardware in my early career and transitioned to Software Engineering.  This was a progression from hardware debug and bring-up through Firmware, Middleware, Frameworks, Product Support, Business Solutions on to Oncology Solutions.</p>

      <h3>The Skill Pool....</h3>
      <p>Thirty plus years in the Technology Industry serving in both the Hardware and Software career positons.  Initially debugging to the component level of complex hardware circuit cards, Test Engineering and onto Firmware and Product Support and Development at IBM.  In summary, I would say that from a skills perspective I my career has been 25 miles wide and 5 miles deep with occasional 10+ mile depths. I have worked with many hardware platforms, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Frameworks, Dev Ops and recently a GA Web Development Immersion 13-week program.  The use of multiple Dev and Build Tools I have been exposed to have also been quite pervasive.</p>
